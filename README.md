## Overview

Space Age is an app that allows you to enter your name and a birthdate. An image that was taken on that date will render to the page in the form of a card with additional information in regards to the image. You can also view more images that were taken the week of your birthday. On top of viewing your weeks worth of pictures/ videos, you can also view the description given to each as well as favorite the cards you love the most! We used vue.js to create this application.


## Learning Goals

Incorporating a new technology into our application that isnâ€™t explicitly taught will give us the opportunity to differentiate ourselves from other Turing grads and give a great story to tell in the job interview - employers love to hear about experiences being self driven and learning new technologies outside of the standard Turing curriculum. As a whole, our group aimed to learn the basics of the Vue.js framework and implement our knowledge to create a single page App which pulled from NASA's picture of the day API and allowed the user to interact with.

## Requirements

- A minimum viable product (MVP) idea that solves a problem for your users
- The use of at least one external API
- Adding favoriting capabilities to the 'Birthday Cards' 
- Having a filtering option for ones favorited cards
- Begin to implement basic unit tests using the new testing framework of vue-test-utils
